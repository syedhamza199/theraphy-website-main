                  Marriage counseling, also called couples therapy, is a type of
                  psychotherapy. Marriage counseling helps couples of all types
                  recognize and resolve conflicts and improve their
                  relationships. Through marriage counseling, you can make
                  thoughtful decisions about rebuilding and strengthening your
                  relationship or going your separate ways.

                  Marriage counseling is often provided by licensed therapists
                  known as marriage and family therapists. These therapists have
                  graduate or postgraduate degrees — and many choose to become
                  credentialed by the American Association for Marriage and
                  Family Therapy (AAMFT).

                  Marriage counseling is often short term. Marriage counseling
                  typically includes both partners, but sometimes one partner
                  chooses to work with a therapist alone. The specific treatment
                  plan depends on the situation, and couples may also explore
                  couple and family counseling options to address relationship
                  issues in a broader context

            <p className="text-start mb-16 font-inter text-xl font-normal text-[#4B5D80]">
              Marriage counseling can help couples in all types of intimate
              relationships — regardless of sexual orientation or marriage
              status.
            </p>

            <p className="text-start mb-16 font-inter text-xl font-normal text-[#4B5D80]">
              Some couples seek marriage counseling to strengthen their
              partnership and gain a better understanding of each other.
              Marriage counseling can also help couples who plan to get married.
              Premarital counseling can help couples achieve a deeper
              understanding of each other and iron out differences before
              marriage.
            </p>

            <p className="text-start mb-16 font-inter text-xl font-normal text-[#4B5D80]">
              In other cases, couples seek marriage counseling to improve a
              troubled relationship. You can use marriage counseling to help
              with many specific issues, including:

            <p className="text-start mb-16 font-inter text-xl font-normal text-[#4B5D80]">
              Marriage counseling might also be helpful in cases of domestic
              abuse. If violence has escalated to the point that you're afraid,
              however, counseling alone isn't adequate. Contact the police or a
              local shelter or crisis center for emergency support. In addition
              to traditional marriage counseling, couples may explore couple and
              family counseling to address relationship issues within a broader
              family context.

            <p className="text-start mb-16 font-inter text-xl font-normal text-[#4B5D80]">
              The only preparation needed for marriage counseling is to find a
              therapist. You can ask your primary care doctor for a referral to
              a therapist. Loved ones, friends, your health insurer, employee
              assistance program, clergy, or state or local mental health
              agencies might offer recommendations. It can be helpful to
              interview several therapists before you decide on one.
            </p>
            <p className="text-start mb-16 font-inter text-xl font-normal text-[#4B5D80]">
              Before scheduling sessions with a specific therapist, consider
              whether the therapist would be a good fit for you and your
              partner. You might ask questions about:
            </p>

            <p className="text-start mb-16 font-inter text-xl font-normal text-[#4B5D80]">
              Education and experience. What is your educational and training
              background? Are you licensed by the state? Are you credentialed by
              the AAMFT? What is your experience with our type of issue?
            </p>
            <p className="text-start mb-16 font-inter text-xl font-normal text-[#4B5D80]">
              Logistics. Where is your office? What are your office hours? Are
              you available in case of an emergency?

            <p className="text-start mb-16 font-inter text-xl font-normal text-[#4B5D80]">

              may also explore couple and family counseling to address
              relationship issues within a broader family context, including
              co-parenting counseling if needed.

              Marriage counseling typically brings couples or partners together
              for joint therapy sessions. Working with a therapist, you'll learn
              skills to solidify your relationship, such as:

                You'll talk about the good and bad parts of your relationship as
                you pinpoint and better understand the sources of your
                conflicts. Together you'll learn how to identify problems
                without blame and instead examine how things can be improved. In
                some cases, couples may also consider couple and family
                counseling to address relationship issues within a broader
                family context.{" "}

            <p className="text-start mb-10 font-inter text-xl font-normal text-[#4B5D80]">
              When thinking about marriage counseling, bear the following in
              mind:
            </p>

            <p className="text-start mb-10 font-inter text-xl font-normal text-[#4B5D80]">
              It might be hard to talk about your problems with the counselor.
              Sessions might pass in silence as you and your partner remain
              angry over perceived wrongs — or you might yell or argue during
              sessions. Both are OK. Your therapist can act as a referee and
              help you cope with the resulting emotions.
            </p>

            <p className="text-start mb-10 font-inter text-xl font-normal text-[#4B5D80]">
              You can go by yourself. If your partner refuses to attend marriage
              counseling sessions, you can still attend. It's more challenging
              to mend a relationship this way, but you can benefit by learning
              more about your reactions and behavior.
            </p>

            <p className="text-start mb-10 font-inter text-xl font-normal text-[#4B5D80]">
              Therapy is often short term. Some people need only a few sessions
              of marriage counseling, while others need it for several months.
              The specific treatment plan will depend on your situation.
              Sometimes, marriage counseling helps couples discover that their
              differences truly are irreconcilable and that it's best to end the
              relationship. Sessions can then focus on skills for ending the
              relationship on good terms. If you're looking for family therapy
              near you, consider contacting a local therapist or counseling
              center to discuss your specific needs and find the right support
              for your situation.
            </p>

            <p className="text-start mb-10 font-inter text-xl font-normal text-[#4B5D80]">
              You might have homework. Your counselor might suggest
              communication exercises at home to help you practice what you've
              learned during your session. For example, talking face-to-face to
              with your partner for a few minutes every day about nonstressful
              things — without any interruptions from TVs, phones or children.
            </p>

            <p className="text-start mb-10 font-inter text-xl font-normal text-[#4B5D80]">
              You or your partner might need additional care. If one of you is
              coping with mental illness, substance abuse or other issues, your
              therapist might work with other health care providers to provide
              more complete treatment.
            </p>

            <p className="text-start mb-10 font-inter text-xl font-normal text-[#4B5D80]">
              Making the decision to go to couple and family counseling can be
              tough. If you have a troubled relationship, however, seeking help
              is more effective than ignoring your problems or hoping they get
              better on their own. Sometimes taking the first step by admitting
              the relationship needs help is the hardest part. Most individuals
              find the experience to be insightful and empowering. If you're
              searching for couple and family counseling near you, consider
              reaching out to a local therapist or counseling center to get the
              support you need.
